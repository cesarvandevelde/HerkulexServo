# Contributing
This library isn't perfect nor is it complete. It does not cover the full
Herkulex feature set, and it is not guaranteed to be bug-free. The library was
created to address the requirements of a personal project, though I hope the
code proves useful to other people as well. With that in mind, contributions are
most welcome! Here are some ideas:

- Found errors or omissions in the documentation? Please [open an issue][issue]
  on Github.
- Using this library on a different hardware setup? Please [let me know][issue]
  whether or not it worked!
- Did you fix a bug or add new features to the code? Open a [pull request][pull]!
