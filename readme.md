# HerkulexServo

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DismalLoathsomeAmericancurl-size_restricted.gif)

This library allows you to control [Herkulex][herkulex] smart servos directly
from an Arduino. These servos are more expensive than the well-known RC-hobby
servos and they are also a bit more complex to use, but they have some cool
features that make them great for small-scale robotics and other mechatronics
projects. This library offers a number of benefits:

- Supports Herkulex DRS-0101 and DRS-0201 smart servos.
- Modern, clean API exposes a broad feature set.
- Robust communication layer that checks and resends garbled data packets.
- Works reliably on an Arduino Uno with `SoftwareSerial` at 115200 Baud.
